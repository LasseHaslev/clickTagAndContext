clickTag
========

Custom clicktag for use in flash banners with custom context menu and goodies

In order to use this in your own project simply follow these 3 points.

  1. Paste it in the first frame (in the actions panel of course)
  2. Change the context items to whatever you like them to be.
  3. Create a blank button that covers the stage with the instance name of clickTag_btn
  
Thats it :)

Hope this is usefull for someone.
